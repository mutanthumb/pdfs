PDF exploration

An ongoing project for the Digital Preservation Unit at the UMich Library has been to get more information about our PDF files in Deep Blue Documents than what is readily available from the system itself. We are interested in "preservation metadata", what version of PDF is it, what system created it, etc. 

The initial set is 134643 files. 

This GitHub repo contains the various scripts I used to analyze the results of running various PDF tools on these files, Tika, JHOVE, and veraPDF as well as sample result files.
