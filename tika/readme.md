A Tika and PDF pile update, I'm still running this, it's been slow going as I'm having it pull all the metadata (not the content) as such the field names have been a bit inconsistent so I'm having it add new field names (to become column headers) as it goes along. 

There are 7978 columns in results from Tika run.
5066 are related to Zotero
774 are pdf:docinfo:custom:NCCL_
1548 have NCCL_ whatever that is...
