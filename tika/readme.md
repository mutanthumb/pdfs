explorePDF.py Tika pulled all the metadata (not the content) as such the field names have been a bit inconsistent so I'm having it add new field names (to become column headers) as it goes along. 

  * There are 7978 columns in results from Tika run.
  * 5066 are related to Zotero
  * 774 are pdf:docinfo:custom:NCCL_
  * 1548 have NCCL_ whatever that is...
  * 516 with PDFAnnotator
